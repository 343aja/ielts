                        Computer Games for Preschoolers: Nintendo's Research and Design
                        Process
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Designing video games for the youngest consumers is a difficult
                        task for producers, who historical! have focused on more "hard
                        core game fans. This article describes the research and design
                        process involved in creating Nintendo DS* games for a preschool
                        audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After consulting with companies who were interested in designing
                        for the Nintendo DS, we decided on three key objectives for our
                        initial exploratory project: understand preschoolers abilities in
                        the context of handheld system game play; understand how
                        preschoolers interact with the Nintendo DS, specifically how they
                        handle the various forms of play and game mechanics offered by the
                        games currently on the market for this system; and understand the
                        expectations of their parents with regard to handheld systems. The
                        research team began by conducting 26 in-home interviews with
                        children in three markets across the US (West coast
                        urban/suburban: Midwest suburban/rural; and East coast
                        urban/suburban)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The preschoolers in this study included 11 boys and 15 girls
                        ranging in age from 3 years and 3 months to 5 years and 11 months.
                        In addition, because previous research we conducted had shown the
                        effects of school-age siblings on game play (demonstrated, for
                        example, by more advanced motor coordination when using a computer
                        mouse), a combination of households was recruited which had
                        preschoolers with and without school-age siblings. In addition, in
                        order to understand both experienced preschool users of the system
                        and those who were new to video games, we split the sample so that
                        thirteen families owned at least one Nintendo DS and thirteen did
                        not. For those households that did not already have a Nintendo DS,
                        one was brought to the interview for the child to play. This
                        allowed us to see both the instinctive movements of the new
                        players (and of the more experienced players when playing new
                        games), as well as the learned movements of the more experienced
                        players. Each of these interviews lasted between one and two hours
                        and included the preschooler, at least one parent, and often
                        siblings and another parent or caregiver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During each interview various questions were asked. From the
                        parents and any older siblings that were available, we found out,
                        where relevant, the purchase decisions surrounding game systems in
                        the household; the family's typical game play habits; levels of
                        parental supervision with regard to gaming; and favorite games
                        played by various family members. Because these interviews were
                        in-home, we were also able to understand the gaming culture in
                        these homes: what types of spaces (communal or private) were used
                        for game play; how the systems were set up; where the handheld
                        play occurred in the house; and the number and type of games and
                        game systems owned. Finally, and most importantly, we talked to
                        each child about their game playing
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to the interviews, the research team had worked with the
                        production team to create a list of issues connected with
                        preschoolers* physical and mental abilities in the context of
                        playing games. It was essential to understand these before
                        developing the games. These ranged from manual dexterity issues
                        related to game controls, to the effectiveness of ingame
                        instructions, to specific operating techniques used in current
                        games that the producers were interested in incorporating in
                        future preschool titles. During the interviews, therefore, the
                        interviewer guided the preschooler through a series of games, so
                        that he/she could observe the interaction, and question both the
                        preschooler and his/her parents on feelings, attitudes, and
                        frustrations that arose during play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the child had previous experience with the Nintendo DS, he/she
                        was first asked to play his/her favorite game on that system. This
                        told the researchers not only about current level of gaming
                        experience, particularly as related to the complexity of the
                        chosen game, but also allowed them to see the child playing a game
                        using procedures he/she was already familiar with. Across the
                        group of preschoolers, the Nintendo DS selections were very broad,
                        including Nintendogs, New Super Mario Bros, Tony Hawk's Proving
                        Ground, and Sonic Rush. The interviewer watched the child play,
                        specifically noting preferences for operating procedures and
                        physical interactions with the device, as well as how easy or hard
                        each operating procedure was for the child. All of the
                        preschoolers were then asked to play with a specific game chosen
                        by our research team in consultation with our producers, The
                        Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure. It was chosen because
                        it was one of the few games on the market with characters that all
                        of this young age group really liked. Also, it incorporated a
                        large variety of operating techniques that highlighted the
                        uniqueness of the Nintendo DS system, including blowing or singing
                        into the microphone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The findings from this initial exploratory study were extensive.
                        After reviewing the results inhouse and discussing the
                        implications for game design, we then outlined our needs to a firm
                        specializing in children's games. We worked intensively with them
                        to base the design for two preschool-targeted Nintendo DS games on
                        what we had learned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the two Nintendo DS games went into development, we began doing
                        formative research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever we developed new game mechanics, we brought preschoolers
                        into our lab to try them, so we could assess not only their
                        simplicity, but also how engaging they were. Once a full version
                        of the Nintendo DS games was ready, we went back into the field
                        and tested with a dozen preschoolers, to make sure that each
                        element of the games worked for the children, and that overall the
                        games were understandable and enjoyable for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also got feedback on what their siblings and parents thought
                        about the games with regard to appropriateness, engagement, and
                        purchase-intent.

                    <h4 class="text-center">The dingo debate</h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; A plans flies a slow pattern over
                        Carlton Hill station, a 3,600 square kilometre ranch in the
                        Kimberley region in northwest Australia. As the plane Circles,
                        those aboard drop 1,000 small pieces of meat, one by one, onto the
                        scrubland below, each piece laced with poison; this practice is
                        known as baiting. Besides 50.000 head of cattle, Cariton Hill is
                        home to the dingo, Australia’s largest mammalian predator and the
                        bane of a grazier’s (cattle farmer's) life. Stuart Mckechnie,
                        manager of Carlton Hill, complain that graziers’ livelihoods are
                        threatened when dingoes prey on cattle. But one man wants the
                        baiting to end, and for dingoes to once again roam Australia’s
                        wide-open spaces. According to Chris Johnson of James Cook
                        University, ‘Australia needs more dingoes to protect our
                        biodiversity.’
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Aboult 4.000 years ago, Asian
                        sailors introduced dingoes to Australia. Throughout the ensuing
                        millennia, these descendants of the wolf spread across the
                        continent and, as the Tasmanian tiger disappeared completely from
                        Australia, dingoes became Australia’s top predators. As
                        agricultural development took place, the European setter found
                        that they could not safely keep their livestock where dingoes
                        roamed. So began one of the most sustained efforts at pest control
                        in Australia's history. Over the last 150 years, dingoes have been
                        shot and poisoned, and fences have been used in attempt to keep
                        them away from livestock. But at the same time, as the European
                        settlers tried to eliminate one native pest from Australia, they
                        introduced more of their own.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1860, the rabbit was unleashed
                        on Australia by a wealthy landowner, and by 1980, rabbits bad
                        covered most of the mainland. Rabbits provided a huge prey base
                        for two other introduced species; the feral (wild) cat and red
                        fox. The interation between foxes, cats and rabbits is a huge
                        problem for native mammals. In good years, rabbit numbers increase
                        dramaticaly, and fox and cat populations grow quickly in response
                        to the abundance of this prey. When bad seasons follow, rabbit
                        numbers are significantly reduced - and the dwindling but still
                        large fox and cat populations ace left with little to eat besides
                        native mammals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Australian mammals generally
                        reproduce much more slowly than rabbits, cats and foxes - an
                        adaptation to prevent overpopulation in the arid environment,
                        where food can be scarce and unreliable - and populations decline
                        because they can't grow fast enough to animals killed by the
                        predators. Johnson says dingoes are the solution to this problem
                        because they keep cat and fox populations under control. Besides
                        regularly eating the smaller predators, dingoes will kill them
                        simply to lessen competition. Dingo packs in large, stable
                        territories and generally have only one fertile female, which
                        limits their rate of increase. In the 4,000 years that dingoes
                        have been in Australia, they have contributed to few, if any,
                        extinctions, Johnson says.

                    <p>
                        <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching out from a desolate spot
                        where three states meet, for 2,500 km in ether direction, is the
                        world's longest fence, two metres high and stretching from the
                        coast in Queensland to the Great Australian Bight in South
                        Austraha; it is there to keep dingoes out of southeast Australia.
                        Though it has been only partly successful in excluding dingoes
                        from the southeast, the fence separates the main types of
                        livestock found in Australia. To the northwest of the fence,
                        cattle predominate; to the southeast, sheep fill the landscape. In
                        fact, Australia is a land dominated by these animals - 25 million
                        cattle, 100 million sheep and just over 20 million people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>F</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no argument that
                        dingoes will prey on sheep if given the chance, they don’t hunt
                        cattle once the calves are much past two or three weeks old,
                        according to Mckechnie. And a study in Queensland suggests that
                        dingoes don’t even prey heavily on the newborn calves unless their
                        staple prey disappears due to deteriorating conditions like
                        drought. This study, co-authored by Lee Allen of the Robert Wicks
                        Researct Centre in Queensland, suggests that the aggressive
                        baiting programs used against dingoes may actually be counter-
                        productive for graziers. When dingoes are removed from an area by
                        baiting, the area is recolonised by younger, more solitary
                        dingoes. These animals aren’t capable of going after the large
                        prey like kangaroos, so they turn to calves. In their study, some
                        of the higrest rates of calf predation occurred in areas that had
                        been baited.

                        <strong>G</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Clifford, general manager of a
                        firm that manages over 200,000 head of cattle, is not convinced by
                        Allen’s assertion, Clifford says, ‘It’s obvious if we drop or
                        loosen control on dingoes, we are going to lose more calves. He
                        doesn't believe that dingoes will go after kangaroos when calves
                        are around. Nor is he pessuaded of dingoes’supposed ecological
                        benefits, saying he is not convinced that they manage to catch
                        that often, believing they are more likely to catch small native
                        animals instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>H</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; McKechnie agrees that dingoes kill
                        the wallabjes (small native animals) that compete with his cattle
                        for food, but points out that in parts of Western Austratia, there
                        are no foxes, and not very many cats. He doesn’t see how relaxing
                        controls on dingoes in his area will improve the ecological
                        balance. Johnson sees a need for a change in philosophy on the
                        part of graziers. There might be a number of different ways of
                        thinking through dingo management in cattle country,’ he says.’At
                        the moment, though, that hasn't got through to graziers. There’s
                        still just one prescription, and that is to bait as widely as
                        possible.

                    <h4 class="text-center">The booming business of nation-branding</h4>
                    <p>
                        The term 'nation brand' first appeared in articles by Simon Anholt
                        at the end of the twentieth century. Anholt had worked in
                        advertising, and he observed that most successful commercial
                        brands came from countries that had positive images, having
                        created successful brands as a nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the 2000s, the nation-branding industry grew quickly. A
                        handful of companies focused specifically on nation-branding,
                        while many others - PR firms, marketing agencies, and management
                        consultancies - offered this as an addition to their other
                        services. Many nations were immediately attracted by these
                        branding services. Keen to be seen as stable and prosperous, the
                        former Soviet republic of Georgia ran ad campaigns in which it
                        measured itself against France or Australia on the basis of things
                        like its success in grape cultivation or its smooth bureaucracy.
                        Each campaign concluded,'And the winner is ... GEORGIA!' Around
                        the same time, Germany decided it was 'The Land ofldeas', while
                        Jamaica called out to potential entrepreneurs who were looking for
                        a bold and creative home.

                    <p>
                        One nation-branding agency is Bloom Consulting, based in Madrid.
                        Often, countries come to Bloom with specific ideas of what they
                        desire. Some governments are after more tourists, while others
                        want so appeal to talented workers or students. Recently,
                        Paraguay's government hired Bloom to renovate its image in order
                        to lift its exports and attract more investment. Flows of foreign
                        direct investment worldwide rose from $865 billion to $1.5 2
                        trillion over a period of 17 years. Even a small slice of such a
                        substantial pie is well worth seeking
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as a nation, a place such as a town or city can also
                        develop a brand. In 1945, the city of The Hague in the Netherlands
                        was picked to be the home of the International Court of Justice.
                        Since then, the city has worked hard to confirm its status as the
                        city of peace and justice. Asa result, anyone planning a
                        convention or event around the theme of justice or security is
                        more than likely to choose The Hague as a destination. Last year,
                        this city of half a million hosted 135 international conferences.
                        On average, a conference lasted four days and drew 279 visitors,
                        each of whom spent €1,200 during their visit, showing that even
                        the more abstract aims of place-branding may have material
                        benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commercial motives aside, the frenzy for nation-branding or
                        place-branding also reflects deeper issues. Every country, region
                        and city now fmds that it has to be a competitor in the vast
                        marketplace that is the world's economy. Some places have never
                        properly played this role before; others have played it so long
                        that they're unused to being challenged. To be noticed, a place
                        must be distinctive, most appear unique. But this is tricky to
                        achieve when a single, bland culture - the culture of the same
                        global market - is everywhere. Although Anholt was one of the
                        first in the field of nation-branding, he now has a new approach
                        towards it. In the late 1990s, he used to create nation brands in
                        the way an advertiser or a corporate marketer would. Now, though,
                        he scorns marketing. His later work focuses very little on
                        communication and branding, and much more on the abstract business
                        of a country's beneficial effect upon the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A well-regarded country, Anholt thinks, does as much for humanity
                        at large as for its own people, although countries need to ensure
                        they are properly run if their reputation is to improve. This
                        thought prompted him to launch the Good Country index, which ranks
                        states by the good they do for the world. Anholt sounds as if he
                        regrets ever introducing the idea of 'nation brand', saying he
                        feels the only people who benefit from it are corrupt PR agencies
                        who encourage poor countries to spend money they can't afford on
                        relatively useless propaganda programmes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The direction in which nation-branding work tends to flow is not
                        ideal either. Nationbranding agencies in New York, Madrid, London
                        and Paris dispense advice to governments in Asia, Africa, eastern
                        Europe and Latin America on how best to present themselves - an
                        arrangement that can easily lead to cultural imperialism. This
                        imbalance is potentially dangerous for practitioner and client
                        alike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The very notion of a national or regional character that the
                        people of Georgia or Jamaica, or of Germany or Holland, are
                        somehow different, although the borders separating them from
                        neighbouring countries may only have been created relatively
                        recently - is problematic. But the impulse of authorities such as
                        churches, kings or governments to define and manipulate such a
                        character is hardly new. However the way that national identity is
                        communicated is changing. This once happened through newspapers
                        and books. Now it happens, at a much more frantic pace, on the
                        banner ads of web pages, at global summits, at investment
                        roadshows, and even as product placements in the movies. Behind
                        these concerns about national identity is the political fear that
                        the nation is being displaced from its position as the most vital
                        unit in world affairs. So much points to this. Governments
                        struggle to cope with the borderless nature of things that might
                        once have been within their jurisdiction: corporations, taxes, the
                        internet and the media, crime, political influence. Even the
                        eagerness to hire brand experts is, in a way, a reaction to this
                        perceived threat of irrelevance an attempt by nations and regions
                        to regroup, to define themselves anew. An attempt to insist that
                        they still matter.
