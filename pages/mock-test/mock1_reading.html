            <h4 class="text-center">Dirty river but clean water</h4>
            <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center">
              Floods can occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity
              of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the
              waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if
              they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine
              flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and
              other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked
              by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because
              rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRE and flood are two of humanity's
              worst nightmares. People have, therefore, always sought to control
              them. Forest fires are snuffed out quickly. The flow of rivers is
              regulated by weirs and dams. At least, that is how it used to be.
              But foresters have learned that forests need fires to clear out
              the brush and even to get seeds to germinate. And a similar
              revelation is now dawning on hydrologists. Rivers â€“ and the
              ecosystems they support â€“ need floods. That is why a man-made
              torrent has been surging down the Grand Canyon. By Thursday, March
              6th it was running at full throttle, which was expected to be
              sustained for 60 hours.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Floods once raged through the canyon
              every year. Spring Snow from as far away as Wyoming would melt and
              swell the Colorado river to a flow that averaged around 1,500
              cubic metres (50,000 cubic feet) a second. Every eight years or
              so, that figure rose to almost 3,000 cubic metres. These floods
              infused the river with sediment, carved its beaches and built its
              sandbars.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the four decades since
              the building of the Glen Canyon dam, just upstream of the Grand
              Canyon, the only sediment that it has collected has come from
              tiny, undammed tributaries. Even that has not been much use as
              those tributaries are not powerful enough to distribute the
              sediment in an ecologically valuable way.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of flooding has harmed
              local wildlife. The humpback chub, for example, thrived in the
              rust-red waters of Colorado. Recently, though, its population has
              crashed. At first sight, it looked as if the reason was that the
              chub were being eaten by trout introduced for sport fishing in the
              mid-20th century. But trout and chub co-existed until the Glen
              Canyon dam was built, so something else is going on. Steve Gloss,
              of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), reckons that the
              chub's decline is the result of their losing their most valuable
              natural defense, Colorado's rusty sediment. The chub were well
              adapted to the poor visibility created by the chick, red water
              which gave the river its name and depended on it to hide from
              predators. Without the cloudy water, the chub became vulnerable.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chub are not alone. In the
              years since the Glen Canyon dam was built, several species have
              vanished altogether. These include the Colorado pike-minnow, the
              razorback sucker and the roundtail chub. Meanwhile, aliens
              including fathead minnows, channel catfish and common carp, which
              would have been hard, put to survive in the savage waters of the
              undammed canyon, have moved in.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>F</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;So flooding is the obvious answer.
              Unfortunately, it is easier said than done. Floods were sent down
              the Grand Canyon in 1996 and 2004 and the results were mixed. In
              1996 the flood was allowed to go on too long. To start with, all
              seemed well. The floodwaters built up sandbanks and infused the
              river with sediment. Eventually, however, the continued flow
              washed most of the sediment out of the canyon. This problem was
              avoided in 2004, but unfortunately, on that occasion, the volume
              of sand available behind the dam was too low to rebuild the
              sandbanks. This time, the USGS is convinced that things will be
              better. The amount of sediment available is three times greater
              than it was in 2004. So if a flood is going to do some good, this
              is the time to unleash one.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>G</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, it may turn out to be an
              empty gesture. At less than 1,200 cubic metres a second, this
              flood is smaller than even an average spring flood, let alone one
              of the mightier deluges of the past. Those glorious inundations
              moved massive quantities of sediment through the Grand Canyon,
              wiping the slate dirty, and making a muddy mess of silt and muck
              that would make modern river rafters cringe.

            <h4 class="text-center">Memory and Age</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging, it is now clear, is part of
              an ongoing maturation process that all our organs go through. "In
              a sense, aging is keyed to the level of the vigor of the body and
              the continuous interaction between levels of body activity and
              levels of mental activity," reports Arnold B. Scheibel, M.D.,
              whose very academic title reflects how once far-flung domains now
              converge on the mind and the brain. Scheibel is a professor of
              anatomy, cell biology, psychiatry, and behavioral sciences at the
              University of California at Los Angeles, and director of
              university's Brain Research Institute. Experimental evidence has
              backed up popular assumptions that the aging mind undergoes decay
              analogous to that of the aging body. Younger monkeys, chimps, and
              lower animals consistently outperform their older colleagues on
              memory tests. In humans, psychologists concluded, memory and other
              mental functions deteriorate over time because of inevitable
              organic changes in the brain as neurons die off. The mental
              decline after young adulthood appeared inevitable.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipped with imaging techniques
              that capture the brain in action, Stanley Rapoport, Ph.D., at the
              National Institutes of Health, measured the flow of blood in the
              brains of old and young people as they went through the task of
              matching photos of faces. Since blood flow reflects neuronal
              activity, Rapoport could compare with networks of neurons were
              being used by different subjects. "Even when the reaction times of
              older and younger subjects were the same, the neural networks they
              used were significantly different. The older subjects were using
              different internal strategies to accomplish the same result in the
              same time," Rapoport says. Either the task required greater effort
              on the part of the older subjects or the work of neurons
              originally involved in tasks of that type had been taken over by
              other neurons, creating different networks.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Georgia Institute of
              Technology, psychologist Timothy Salthouse, Ph.D., compared a
              group of very fast and accurate typists of college-age with
              another group in their 60s. since reaction time is faster in
              younger people and most people's fingers grow less nimble with
              age, younger typists might be expected to tap right along while
              the older one's fumble. But both typed 60 words a minute. The
              older typists, it turned out, achieved their speed with cunning
              little strategies that made them far more efficient than their
              younger counterparts: They made fewer finger movements, saving a
              fraction of a second here and there. They also read ahead in the
              text. The neural networks involved in typing appear to have been
              reshaped to compensate for losses in motor skills or other age
              changes.

              <strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a rat is kept in isolation
              without playmates or objects to interact with, the animal's brain
              shrinks, but if we put that rat with 11 other rats in a large cage
              and give them an assortment of wheels, ladders, and other toys, we
              can showâ€”after four daysâ€”significant differences in its brain,"
              says Diamond, professor of integrative biology. Proliferating
              dendrites first appear in the visual association areas. After a
              month in the enriched environment, the whole cerebral cortex has
              expanded, a has its blood supply. Even in the enriched
              environment, rats get bored unless the toys are varied. "Animals
              are just like we are. They need stimulation," says Diamond.

            <p>
              One of the most profoundly important mental functions is
              memory-notorious for its failure with age. So important is a
              memory that the Charles A. Dana foundation recently spent $8.4
              million to set up a consortium of leading medical centers to
              measure memory loss and aging through brain-imaging technology,
              neurochemical experiment, and cognitive and psychological tests.
              One thing, however, is already fairly clearâ€”many aspects of memory
              are not a function of age at all but of education. Memory exists
              in more than one form. What we call knowledgeâ€”factsâ€”is what
              psychologists such as Harry P. Bahrick, Ph.D., of Ohio Wesleyan
              University call semantic memory. Events, conversations, and
              occurrences in time and space, on the other hand, make up episodic
              or event memory, which is triggered by cues from the context. If
              you were around in 1963 you don't need to be reminded of the
              circumstances surrounding the moment you heard that JFK had been
              assassinated. That event is etched into your episodic memory.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you forget a less vivid item,
              like buying a roll of paper towels at the supermarket, you may
              blame it on your aging memory. It's true that episodic memory
              begins to decline when most people are in their 50s, but it's
              never perfect at any age. "Every memory begins as an event," says
              Bahrick. "Through repetition, certain events leave behind a
              residue of knowledge or semantic memory. On a specific day in the
              past, somebody taught you that two and two are four, but you've
              been over that information so often you don't remember where you
              learned it. What started as an episodic memory has become a
              permanent part of your knowledge base." You remember the content,
              not the context. Our language knowledge, our knowledge of the
              world and of people, is largely that permanent or semi-permanent
              residue.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>F</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Probing the longevity of knowledge,
              Bahrick tested 1,000 high school graduates to see how well they
              recalled their algebra. Some had completed the course as recently
              as a month before, others as long as 50 years earlier. He also
              determined how long each person had studied algebra, the grade
              received, and how much the skill was used over the course of
              adulthood. Surprisingly, a person's grasp of algebra at the time
              of testing did not depend on how long ago he'd taken the
              courseâ€”the determining factor was the duration of instruction.
              Those who had spent only a few months learning algebra forgot most
              of it within two or three years.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>G</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In another study, Bahrick discovered
              that people who had taken several courses in Spanish, spread out
              over a couple of years, could recall, decades later, 60 per cent
              or more of the vocabulary they learned. Those who took just one
              course retained only a trace after three years. "This long-term
              residue of knowledge remains stable over the decades, independent
              of the age of the person and the age of the memory. No serious
              deficit appears until people get to their 50s and 60s, probably
              due to the degenerative processes of aging rather than a cognitive
              loss."
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>H</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could say metamemory is a
              byproduct of going to school," says psychologist Robert Kail,
              Ph.D., of Purdue University, who studies children from birth to 20
              years, the time of life when mental development is most rapid.
              "The question-and-answer process, especially exam-taking, helps
              children learnâ€”and also teaches them how their memory works. This
              may be one reason why, according to a broad range of studies in
              people over 60, the better educated a person is, the more likely
              they are to perform better in life and on psychological tests. A
              group of adult novice chess players were compared with a group of
              child experts at the game. In tests of their ability to remember a
              random series of numbers, the adults, as expected, outscored the
              children. But when asked to remember the patterns of chess pieces
              arranged on a board, the children won. "Because they'd played a
              lot of chess, their knowledge of chess was better organized than
              that of the adults, and their existing knowledge of chess served
              as a framework for new memory," explains Kail.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized knowledge is a mental
              resource that only improve with time. Crystallized intelligence
              about one's occupation apparently does not decline at all until at
              least age 75, and if there is no disease or dementia, may remain
              even longer. Special knowledge is often organized by a process
              called "chunking." If procedure A and procedure B are always done
              together, for example, the mind may merge them into a single
              command. When you apply yourself to a specific interestâ€”say,
              cookingâ€”you build increasingly elaborate knowledge structures that
              let you do more and do it better. This ability, which is tied to
              experience, is the essence of expertise. Vocabulary is one such
              specialized form of accrued knowledge. Research clearly shows that
              vocabulary improves with time. Retired professionals, especially
              teachers and journalists, consistently score higher on tests of
              vocabulary and general information than college students, who are
              supposed to be in their mental prime.

              Ten years ago Michael Krauss sent a shudder through the discipline
              of linguistics with his prediction that half the 6,000 or so
              languages spoken in the world would cease to be uttered within a
              century. Unless scientists and community leaders directed a
              worldwide effort to stabilize the decline of local languages, he
              warned, nine-tenths of the linguistic diversity of humankind would
              probably be doomed to extinction. Krauss's prediction was little
              more than an educated guess, but other respected linguists had
              been clanging out similar alarms. Keneth L. Hale of the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted in the same journal
              issue that eight languages on which he had done fieldwork had
              since passed into extinction. A 1990 survey in Australia found
              that 70 of the 90 surviving Aboriginal languages were no longer
              used regularly by all age groups. The same was true for all but 20
              of the 175 Native American languages spoken or remembered in the
              US., Krauss told a congressional panel in 1992.

              Many experts in the field mourn the loss of rare languages, for
              several reasons. To start, there is scientific self-interest: some
              of the most basic questions in linguistics have to do with the
              limits of human speech, which are far from fully explored. Many
              researchers would like to know which structural elements of
              grammar and vocabulary â€“ if any â€“ are truly universal and
              probably, therefore, hardwired into the human brain. Other
              scientists try to reconstruct ancient migration patterns by
              comparing borrowed words that appear in otherwise unrelated
              languages. In each of these cases, the wider the portfolio of
              languages you study, the more likely you are to get the right
              answers.

              Despite the near-constant buzz in linguistics about endangered
              languages over the past 10 years, the field has accomplished
              depressingly little. "You would think that there would be some
              organized response to this dire situation," some attempt to
              determine which language can be saved and which should be
              documented before they disappear, says Sarah G. Thomason, a
              linguist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. "But there
              isn't any such effort organized in the profession. It is only
              recently that it has become fashionable enough to work on
              endangered languages." Six years ago, recalls Douglas H. Whalen of
              Yale University, "when I asked linguists who were raising money to
              deal with these problems, I mostly got blank stares." So Whalen
              and a few other linguists founded the Endangered Languages Fund.
              In the five years to 2001, they were able to collect only $80,000
              for research grants. A similar foundation in England, directed by
              Nicholas Ostler, has raised just $8,000 since 1995.

              But there are encouraging signs that the field has turned a
              corner. The Volkswagen Foundation, a German charity, just issued
              its second round of grants totaling more than $2 million. It has
              created a multimedia archive at the Max Planck Institute for
              Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands that can house recordings,
              grammars, dictionaries and other data on endangered languages. To
              fill the archive, the foundation has dispatched field linguists to
              document Aweti (100 or so speakers in Brazil), Ega (about 300
              speakers in Ivory Coast), Waima'a (a few hundred speakers in East
              Timor), and a dozen or so other languages unlikely to survive the
              century. The Ford Foundation has also edged into the arena. Its
              contributions helped to reinvigorate a master-apprentice program
              created in 1992 by Leanne Hinton of Berkeley and Native Americans
              worried about the imminent demise of about 50 indigenous languages
              in California. Fluent speakers receive $3,000 to teach a younger
              relative (who is also paid) their native tongue through 360 hours
              of shared activities, spread over six months. So far about 5 teams
              have completed the program, Hinton says, transmitting a least some
              knowledge of 25 languages. "It's too early to call this language
              revitalization," Hinton admits. "In California, the death rate of
              elderly speakers will always be greater than the recruitment rate
              of young speakers. But at least we prolong the survival of the
              language." That will give linguists more time to record these
              tongues before they vanish.

              But the master-apprentice approach hasn't caught on outside the
              U.S., and Hinton's effort is a drop in the sea. At least 440
              languages have been reduced to a mere handful of elders, according
              to the Ethnologue, a catalogue of languages produced by the
              Dallas-based group SIL International that comes closest to global
              coverage. For the vast majority of these languages, there is
              little or no record of their grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation or
              use in daily life. Even if a language has been fully documented,
              all that remains once it vanishes from active use is a fossil
              skeleton, a scattering of features that the scientist was lucky
              and astute enough to capture. Linguists may be able to sketch an
              outline of the forgotten language and fix its place on the
              evolutionary tree, but little more. "How did people start
              conversations and talk to babies? How dis husbands and wives
              converse?" Hinton asks. "Those are the first things you want to
              learn when you want to revitalize the language."

              But there is as yet no discipline of "conservation linguistics,"
              as there is for biology. Almost every strategy tried so far has
              succeeded in some places but failed in others, and there seems to
              be no way to predict with certainty what will work where. Twenty
              years ago in New Zealand, Maori speakers set up "language nests,"
              in which preschoolers were immersed in the native language.
              Additional Maori-only classes were added as the children
              progressed through elementary and secondary school. A similar
              approach was tried in Hawaii, with some success â€“ the number of
              native speakers has stabilized at 1,000 or so, reports Joseph E.
              Grimes of SIL International, who is working on Oahu. Students can
              now get instruction in Hawaiian all the way through university.

              One factor that always seems to occur in the demise of a language
              is that the speakers begin to have collective doubts about the
              usefulness of language loyalty. Once they start regarding their
              own language as inferior to the majority language, people stop
              using it in all situations. Kids pick up on the attitude and
              prefer the dominant language. In many cases, people don't notice
              until they suddenly realize that their kids never speak the
              language, even at home. This is how Cornish and some dialects of
              Scottish Gaelic is still only rarely used for daily home life in
              Ireland, 80 years after the republic was founded with Irish as its
              first official language.

              Linguists agree that ultimately, the answer to the problem of
              language extinction is multilingualism. Even uneducated people
              canz learn several languages, as long as they start as children.
              Indeed, most people in the world speak more than one tongue, and
              in places such as Cameroon (279 languages), Papua New Guinea (823)
              and India (387) it is common to speak three of four distinct
              languages and a dialect or two as well. Most Americans and
              Canadians, to the west of Quebec, have a gut reaction that anyone
              speaking another language in front of them is committing an
              immoral act. You get the same reaction in Australia and Russia. It
              is no coincidence that these are the areas where languages are
              disappearing the fastest. The first step in saving dying languages
              is to persuade the world's majorities to allow the minorities
              among them to speak with their own voices.

                    Floods are people's nightmare. In the past, the canyon was
                    raged by flood every year. The snow from far Wyoming would

                    decades after people built the Glen Canyon Dam, it only
                    could gather

                    Then several species disappeared including Colorado

                    flooding became more serious.
