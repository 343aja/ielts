                    <p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Onion growers in eastern Oregon are adopting a system that saves
                        water and keeps topsoil in place while producing the highest quality “super-colossal” onions.
                        Pear growers in southern Oregon have reduced their use of some of the most toxic pesticides by
                        up to two-thirds, and are still producing top-quality pear. Range managers throughout the state
                        have controlled the poisonous weed tansy ragwort with insect predators and saved the Oregon
                        livestock industry up to $4.8 million a year.</p>
                    <p><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the results Oregon growers have achieved in
                        collaboration with Oregon State University (OSU) researchers as they test new farming methods
                        including integrated pest management (IPM). Nationwide, however, IPM has not delivered results
                        comparable to those in Oregon. A recent U.S General Accounting Office (GAO) report indicates
                        that while integrated pest management can result in dramatically reduced pesticide use, the
                        federal government has been lacking in effectively promoting that goal and implementing IPM.
                        Farmers also blame the government for not making the new options of pest management attractive.
                        “Wholesale changes in the way that farmers control the pests on their farms is an expensive
                        business.” Tony Brown, of the National Farmers Association, says. “If the farmers are given tax
                        breaks to offset the expenditure, then they would willingly accept the new practices.” The
                        report goes on to note that even though the use of the riskiest pesticides has declined
                        nationwide, they still make up more than 40 percent of all pesticides used today; and national
                        pesticide use has risen by 40 million kilograms since 1992. “Our food supply remains the safest
                        and highest quality on Earth but we continue to overdose our farmland with powerful and toxic
                        pesticides and to under-use the safe and effective alternatives,” charged Patrick Leahy, who
                        commissioned the report. Green action groups disagree about the safety issue. “There is no way
                        that habitual consumption of foodstuffs grown using toxic chemical of the nature found on
                        today’s farms can be healthy for consumers,” noted Bill Bowler, spokesman for Green Action, one
                        of many lobbyists interested in this issue.</p>
                    <p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The GAO report singles out Oregon’s apple and pear producers who
                        have used the new IPM techniques with growing success. Although Oregon is clearly ahead of the
                        nation, scientists at OSU are taking the Government Accounting Office criticisms seriously. “We
                        must continue to develop effective alternative practices that will reduce environmental hazards
                        and produce high-quality products,” said Paul Jepson, a professor of entomology at OSU and new
                        director of</p>
                    <p><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;OSU’s Integrated Plant Protection Centre (IPPC). The IPPC brings
                        together scientists from OSU’s Agricultural Experiment Station, OSU Extension service, the U.S.
                        Department of Agriculture and Oregon farmers to help develop agricultural systems that will save
                        water and soil, and reduce pesticides. In response to the GAO report, the Centre is putting even
                        more emphasis on integrating research and farming practices to improve Oregon agriculture
                        environmentally and economically.</p>
                    <p><strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;“The GAO report criticizes agencies for not clearly communicating
                        the goals of IPM,” said Jepson. “Our challenge is to greatly improve the communication to and
                        from growers, to learn what works and what doesn’t. the work coming from OSU researchers must be
                        adopted in the field and not simply languish in scientific journals.”</p>
                    <p><strong>F</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oregon, growers and scientists are working together to instigate
                        new practices. For example, a few years ago scientists at OSU’s Malheur Experiment Station began
                        testing a new drip irrigation system to replace old ditches that wasted water and washed soil
                        and fertilizer into streams. The new system cut water and fertilizer use by half kept topsoil in
                        place and protected water quality.</p>
                    <p><strong>G</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the new system produced crops of very large onions,
                        rated “super-colossal” and highly valued by the restaurant industry and food processors. Art
                        Pimms, one of the researchers at Malheur comments: “Growers are finding that when they adopt
                        more environmentally benign practices, they can have excellent results. The new practices
                        benefit the environment and give the growers their success.”</p>
                    <p><strong>H</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;OSU researcher in Malheur next tested straw mulch and found that it
                        successfully held soil in place and kept the ground moist with less irrigation. In addition, and
                        unexpectedly, the scientists found that the mulched soil created a home for beneficial beetles
                        and spiders that prey on onion thrips – a notorious pest in commercial onion fields – a
                        discovery that could reduce the need for pesticides. “I would never have believed that we could
                        replace the artificial pest controls that we had before and still keep our good results,”
                        commented Steve Black, a commercial onion farmer in Oregon, “but instead we have actually
                        surpassed expectations.”</p>
                    <p><strong>I</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;OSU researchers throughout the state have been working to reduce
                        dependence on broad-spectrum chemical spays that are toxic to many kinds of organisms, including
                        humans. “Consumers are rightly putting more and more pressure on the industry to change its
                        reliance on chemical pesticides, but they still want a picture-perfect product,” said Rick
                        Hilton, an entomologist at OSU’s Southern Oregon Research and Extension Centre, where researches
                        help pear growers reduce the need for highly toxic pesticides. Picture perfect pears are an
                        important product in Oregon and traditionally they have required lots of chemicals. In recent
                        years, the industry has faced stiff competition from overseas producers, so any new methods that
                        growers adopt must make sense economically as well as environmentally. Hilton is testing a
                        growth regulator that interferes with the molting of codling moth larvae. Another study used
                        pheromone dispensers to disrupt codling moth mating. These and other methods of integrated pest
                        management have allowed pear growers to reduce their use of organophosphates by two-thirds and
                        reduce all other synthetic pesticides by even more and still produce top-quality pears. These
                        and other studies around the state are part of the effort of the IPPC to find alternative
                        farming practices that benefit both the economy and the environment.</p>

                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="14">14</div>
                    <p>Crocodiles have been around for 200 million years, but they’re certainly not primitive. The early
                        forms of crocodiles are known as Crocodilian. Since they spent most of their life beneath water,
                        accordingly their body adapted to aquatic lifestyle. Due to the changes formed within their body
                        shape and tendency to adapt according to the climate they were able to survive when most of the
                        reptiles of their period are just a part of history. In their tenure on Earth, they’ve endured
                        the impacts of meteors, planetary refrigeration, extreme upheavals of the Earth’s tectonic
                        surface and profound climate change. They were around for the rise and fall of the dinosaurs,
                        and even 65 million years of supposed mammalian dominance has failed to loosen their grip on the
                        environments they inhabit. Today’s crocodiles and alligators are little changed from their
                        prehistoric ancestors, a telling clue that these reptiles were (and remain) extremely well
                        adapted to their environment.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="15">15</div>
                    <p>The first crocodile-like ancestors appeared about 230 million years ago, with many of the
                        features that make crocs such successful stealth hunters already in place: streamlined body,
                        long tail, protective armour and long jaws. They have long head and a long tail that helps them
                        to change their direction in water while moving. They have four legs which are short and are
                        webbed. Never underestimate their ability to move on ground. When they move they can move at
                        such a speed that won’t give you a second chance to make a mistake by going close to them
                        especially when hungry. They can lift their whole body within seconds from ground. The fastest
                        way by which most species can move is a sort of “belly run”, where the body moves like a snake,
                        members huddled to the side paddling away frenetically while the tail whips back and forth. When
                        “belly running” Crocodiles can reach speeds up to 10 or 11 km/h (about 7mph), and often faster
                        if they are sliding down muddy banks. Other form of movement is their “high walk”, where the
                        body is elevated above the ground.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="16">16</div>
                    <p>Crocodilians have no lips. When submerged in their classic ‘sit and wait’ position, their mouths
                        fill with water. The nostrils on the tip of the elongated snout lead into canals that run
                        through bone to open behind the valve – allowing the crocodilian to breathe through its nostrils
                        even though its mouth is under water. When the animal is totally submerged, another valve seals
                        the nostrils, so the crocodilian can open its mouth to catch prey with no fear of drowning. The
                        thin skin on the crocodilian head and face is covered with tiny, pigmented domes, forming a
                        network of neural pressure receptors that can detect barely perceptible vibrations in the water.
                        This enables a crocodile lying in silent darkness to suddenly throw its head sideways and grasp
                        with deadly accuracy small prey moving close by.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="17">17</div>
                    <p>Like other reptiles, crocodiles are endothermic animals (cold-blooded, or whose body temperature
                        varies with the temperature of the surrounding environment) and, therefore, need to sunbathe, to
                        raise the temperature of the body. On the contrary, if it is too hot, they prefer being in water
                        or in the shade. Being a cold-blooded species, the crocodilian heart is unique in having an
                        actively controlled valve that can redirect, at will, blood flow away from the lungs and
                        recirculate it around the body, taking oxygen to where it’s needed most. In addition, their
                        metabolism is a very slow one, so, they can survive for long periods without feeding. Crocodiles
                        are capable of slowing their metabolism even further allowing them to survive for a full year
                        without feeding. Compared to mammals and birds, crocodilians have slow metabolisms that burn
                        much less fuel, and are ideally suited to relatively unstable environments that would defeat
                        mammals with their high food demands.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="18">18</div>
                    <p>Crocodiles use a very effective technique to catch the prey. The prey remains almost unaware of
                        the fact that there can be any crocodile beneath water. It is due to the fact that when the
                        crocodile sees its prey it moves under water without making any noise and significant movement.
                        It keeps only its eyes above water surface. When it feels it has reached sufficiently close to
                        the target it whistles out of water with wide open jaws. 80 percent of their attempts are
                        successful. They have very powerful jaws. Once the prey trapped in its jaws they swallow it.
                        Their power can be judged from the fact they can kill the wild zebras which come to watery areas
                        in search of water. They do not chew their food. They normally feed on small animals, big fish,
                        birds and even human flesh. As like some water creatures that interact by making sounds
                        crocodiles also use many sounds to communicate with other crocodiles. They exist where
                        conditions have remained the same and they are free of human interference. The crocodile is
                        successful because it switches its feeding methods. It hunts fish, grabs birds at the surface,
                        hides among the water edge vegetation to wait for a gazelle to come by, and when there is a
                        chance for an ambush, the crocodile lunges forward, knocks the animal with its powerful tail and
                        then drags it to water where it quickly drowns. Another way is to wait motionless for an animal
                        to come to the water’s edge and grabs it by its nose where it is held to drown.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="19">19</div>
                    <p>In many places inhabited by crocodilians, the hot season brings drought that dries up their
                        hunting grounds and takes away the means to regulate their body temperature. They allowed
                        reptiles to dominate the terrestrial environment. Furthermore, many crocs protect themselves
                        from this by digging burrows and entombing themselves in mud, waiting for months without access
                        to food or water, until the rains arrive. To do this, they sink into a quiescent state called
                        aestivation.</p>
                    <div class="drop-zone" data-dnd-group="p2-14-20" data-q="20">20</div>
                    <p>Most of (At least nine species of) crocodilian are thought to aestivate during dry periods.
                        Kennett and Christian’s six-year study of Australian freshwater crocodiles – Crocodylus
                        johnstoni (the King Crocodiles). The crocodiles spent almost four months a year underground
                        without access to water. Doubly labeled water was used to measure field metabolic rates and
                        water flux, and plasma (and cloacal fluid samples were taken at approximately monthly intervals
                        during some years to monitor the effects of aestivation with respect to the accumulation of
                        nitrogenous wastes and electrolyte concentrations. Double found that the crocodiles’ metabolic
                        engines tick over, producing waste and using up water and fat reserves. Waste products are
                        stored in the urine, which gets increasingly concentrated as the months pass. However, the
                        concentration of waste products in the blood changes very little, allowing the crocodiles to
                        function normally. Furthermore, though the animals lost water and body mass (just over one-tenth
                        of their initial mass) while underground, the losses were proportional: on emergence, the
                        aestivating crocodiles were not dehydrated and exhibited no other detrimental effects such as a
                        decreased growth rate. Kennett and Christian believe this ability of individuals to sit out the
                        bad times and endure long periods of enforced starvation must surely be key to the survival of
                        the crocodilian line through time.</p>

                        consider the following past societies to have been famous victims of full-fledged collapses
                        rather than of just minor declines: the Anasazi and Cahokia within the boundaries of the modem
                        US, the Maya cities in Central American, Moche and Tiwanaku societies in South America, Norse
                        Greenland, Mycenean Greece and Minoan Crete in Europe, Great Zimbabwe in Africa, Angkor Wat and
                        the Harappan Indus Valley cities in Asia, and Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                    <p><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The monumental ruins left behind by those past societies hold a
                        fascination for all of us. We marvel at them when as children we first learn of them through
                        pictures. When we grow up, many of us plan vacations in order to experience them at first hand.
                        We feel drawn to their often spectacular and haunting beauty, and also to the mysteries that
                        they pose. The scales of the ruins testify to the former wealth and power of their builders. Yet
                        these builders vanished, abandoning the great structures that they had created at such effort.
                        How could a society that was once so mighty end up collapsing?</p>
                    <p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has long been suspected that many of those mysterious
                        abandonments were at least partly triggered by ecological problems: people inadvertently
                        destroying the environmental resources on which their societies depended. This suspicion of
                        unintended ecological suicide (ecocide) has been confirmed by discoveries made in recent decades
                        by archaeologists, climatologists, historians, palaeontologists, and palynologists (pollen
                        scientists). The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging
                        their environments fall into eight categories, whose relative importance differs from case to
                        case: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems, water management problems,
                        overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population
                        growth, and increased impact of people.</p>
                    <p><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those past collapses tended to follow somewhat similar courses
                        constituting variations on a theme. Writers find it tempting to draw analogies between the
                        course of human societies and the course of individual human lives – to talk of a society’s
                        birth, growth, peak, old age and eventual death. But that metaphor proves erroneous for many
                        past societies: they declined rapidly after reaching peak numbers and power, and those rapid
                        declines must have come as a surprise and shock to their citizens. Obviously, too, this
                        trajectory is not one that all past societies followed unvaryingly to completion: different
                        societies collapsed to different degrees and in somewhat different ways, while many societies
                        did not collapse at all.</p>
                    <p><strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today many people feel that environmental problems overshadow all
                        the other threats to global civilisation. These environmental problems include the same eight
                        that undermined past societies, plus four new ones: human-caused climate change, the build-up of
                        toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilisation of the Earth’s
                        photosynthetic capacity. But the seriousness of these current environmental problems is
                        vigorously debated. Are the risks greatly exaggerated, or conversely are they underestimated?
                        Will modem technology solve our problems, or is it creating new problems faster than it solves
                        old ones? When we deplete one resource (eg wood, oil, or ocean fish), can we count on being able
                        to substitute some new resource (eg plastics, wind and solar energy, or farmed fish)? Isn’t the
                        rate of human population growth declining, such that we’re already on course for the world’s
                        population to level off at home manageable number of people?</p>
                    <p><strong>F</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions like this illustrate why those famous collapses of past
                        civilisations have taken on more meaning than just that of a romantic mystery. Perhaps there are
                        some practical lessons that we could learn from all those past collapses. But there are also
                        differences between the modem world and its problems, and those past societies and their
                        problems. We shouldn’t be so naive as to think that the study of the past will yield simple
                        solutions, directly transferable to our societies today. We differ from past societies in some
                        respects that put us at lower risk than them; some of those respects often mentioned include our
                        powerful technology (ie its beneficial effects), globalisation, modem medicine, and greater
                        knowledge of past societies and of distant modem societies. We also differ from past societies
                        in some respects that put us at greater risk than them: again, our potent technology (ie its
                        unintended destructive effects), globalisation (such that now a problem in one part of the world
                        affects all the rest), the dependence of millions of us on modern medicine for our survival, and
                        our much larger human population. Perhaps we can still learn from the past, but only if we think
                        carefully about its lessons.</p>
